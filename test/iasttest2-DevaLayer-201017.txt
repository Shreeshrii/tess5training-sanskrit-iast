like a heap, the letter and Word are not separated,
one half may be said to be the letter and the
other half, the word. Just as the whole can never
be talked of as apart from its parts; so a word
cannot be uttered apart from its constituent letters.
Hence the Smriti : “ The Goddess is the Ardha-
mātrā which is unntterable in any specific way ”
( i. e. apart from the letters ). [ Markandeya
FPurana—Durgasaptasati I.]
